# LilyPond Engraving Quickstart (LEQ)

## Goal

The goal of this project is to speed up the process of making a score using LilyPond, by having almost all non-notational aspects covered and standardised out-of-the-box.

This Engraving Quickstart is mainly tailored to my own needs for styling and notation rules. Nonetheless, some or even all of this repository might be useful to you. Feel free to use as you like. (See `LICENSE.md`).

---

## Getting started

### new_song.ly

Goto `LilyPond-Engraving-Quickstart/new_song.ly` and rename the file to the name of your song. Then open this file in your favourite LilyPond editing software.

In this file the comments and include files will guide you where you need to be - in lieu of a finished manual.

> **Note:** This project makes use of non-standard fonts. You will need to either instal them or comment out the include-file that calls for them. Should you want to instal them, they can be found in the folder `fonts-to-install` in the root of this repository.

## Examples

As I make more scores (that can be open to the public) with LEQ, I will append them in the list below:
