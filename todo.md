In random order

- [ ] (Prepare) multiple parts support for woodwinds and brass (with \partcombine)
    - [X] Before this can be done, an "empty part" variable is needed.
- [X] Rewrite scoring to use tags, to make \tempomarkings(...) obsolete
- [ ] Big overhaul to adjust nomenclature and files/folders to the new use of \book rather than \bookpart
- [ ] Make the individual part prints be their own \book, so they can be sized to wish
    - [ ] And give them a more helpful filename with \bookOutputSuffix
- [ ] Add more frequently used instruments to the instrument library (and voices)
